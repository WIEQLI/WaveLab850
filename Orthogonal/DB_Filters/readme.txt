This folder contains the filters for the boundary wavelets introduced in the
following paper.

A. Cohen, I. Daubechies, and P. Vial, Wavelets on the interval and fast wavelet transforms, Appl. Comp. Harm. Anal., 1 (1), pp. 54-81, 1993. 

They have been computed for the Daubechies wavelets with minimum phase 
using code from https://github.com/oyvindry/applinalgcode
